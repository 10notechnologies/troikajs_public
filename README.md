# troikagame.com AI source code
Public respository for troikagame.com. Right now this repo contains the AI (module directory) and the Emscripten configuration (modulejs) for generating the single player AI.

It also contains a periodically updated dump of every hand that has been played. This data can be used freely for Machine Learning projects. If you do something with it, let us know!!!
